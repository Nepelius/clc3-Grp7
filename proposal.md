# CLC3 proposal of monitoring with Grafana/Prometheus
## Group Members
* Lukas Nepelius
* Ines Neidhard
* Severin Pichler
## Proposal
The goal is to observe an application with Prometheus and Grafana. Therefore, we first build an application to expose various metrics. Then, we will set up Prometheus to collect those metrics and to alert in case of issues. Afterwards, we will set up Grafana to visualize our monitored applications. In our demo, we will present Prometheus and Grafana, as well as run a simulation to cause an alert. 
## Milestones
* Lukas: Responsible for setting up Prometheus with our custom application
* Ines: Inegrating Grafana to visualize metrics
* Severin: Building the monitorable application
* All: Deploy application to the cloud
